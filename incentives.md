## Health of the Ethereum Network

A primary incentive of stakers to participate is to support the ongoing health of the Ethereum network. They can support network health and decentralization along many dimensions including but not limited to geographical, jurisdictional, hardware and software choices, ISP choices, and stake ownership distribution. A robustly decentralized validator set is vital for the long term health and success of Ethereum and results in important qualities such as genuine censorship resistance, a resilient economic security model, and global reliability. More network health data can be found [here](https://ethernodes.org/) and [here](https://explorer.rated.network/network).

## Protocol Rewards

Stakers receive financial rewards from the Ethereum protocol for validating the network. These rewards accrue to validators through activities including [attestations](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/attestations/), [block proposals](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/block-proposal/), [sync committee participation](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#sync-committee), [fees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/), and [MEV](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/mev/). Rewards can also be penalized if the protocol rules are not followed. More details about protocol rewards and penalties can be found [here](https://docs.ethstaker.org/rewards/chain-rewards) and [here](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/rewards-and-penalties/).

## Airdrops

Stakers have periodically received airdrops as recognition for their contributions to securing the Ethereum network. Learn more about past [Airdrops](/airdrops).

## NFT Projects

Some projects have launched NFTs specifically targeted at stakers to reward them for their commitment to securing the network.
Examples:

- [Guardians of the Ether](https://www.etherguardians.xyz/)

## Communities

Several communities have formed to support and recognize the efforts of stakers. These communities provide resources, opportunities, and support networks to enhance the staking experience. Learn more about [Allied Communities](/staking-communities).
