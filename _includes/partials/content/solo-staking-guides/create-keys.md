- Do not give it to ANYONE. No one needs your 24 word seed to help you troubleshoot. Even if you think you trust someone - if they ask you to input your seed into something thatâ€™s online, they are trying to scam you
- Do not put it online
    - Do not keep it in an online password manager (e.g. LastPass, 1Password, Bitwarden, Apple Keychain, etc)
    - Do not keep a cloud backup of it
    - Do not email to ANYONE, including yourself
    - Do not type it on an online computer
- Do not store it on network attached storage (NAS) that has ports open to the outside world (e.g. if you have a Plex server that others have access to)
- Do not keep all 24 written words in your wallet or anywhere else easily accessible"

**Low tech**

- Consider writing it down on a piece of paper and keeping that piece of paper in a locked location
- Consider splitting up the 24 word seed [into three pieces](https://www.bitcoininsider.org/article/56719/shamirs-secret-explained-distributing-seed-phrase-multiple-parts) and storing the pieces in different, locked locations
- Consider engraving it on a piece of metal or buying a product that will store it in metal (e.g. [Cryptosteel](https://cryptosteel.com/)) and storing that in a locked location

**High tech**

- Consider storing it on one or more encrypted, fresh, never-online USB drives
- Consider keeping it in an offline password manager on an airgapped computer (a computer that has never been online)
- Use a [Safe multisig](https://safe.global/) for a withdrawal address and use multiple methods to back up the keys of each of the signers on the multisig"

We cannot stress this enough. **DO NOT LOSE THIS SEED PHRASE**. There is **NO WAY** to get your funds back if you lose this seed phrase or if someone else is able to access it.
